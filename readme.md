# Pursuit Interview

Requested interview materials are located in this repository.

1. [Curriculum](./curriculum.md)

   Intended to be read before the in-person/online lesson.

1. [Lesson](./lesson.md)

   Intended to be used as both a student and instructor resource during the in-person/online lesson.

1. [Checkpoint](./checkpoint/instructions.md)

   Intended to be completed either after the lesson or as homework, depending on time.

I discuss each of these in more detail in the [Wiki](https://github.com/bwreid/pursuit-interview-lesson/wiki).
